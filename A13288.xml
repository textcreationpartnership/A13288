            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18660:3"/> wherefore I was bound to make ſome remonſtrance of my thankfulnes; and wanting other meanes I tooke this opportunitie. Againe, I was not onely ſet on worke to ſtudy this booke; but alſo much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and holped herein, by your moſt honourable, wiſe, learned, and godly Father my deareſt Lord; and therefore was to returne the fruites of my labour to his houſe. And further, I giuing it abroad in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of my nation, as a counterpoyſon againſt the ſhameleſſe fraudes of popiſh ſeducers; your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips experience affoording you greater ſatisfaction of the times than can be knowne by bookes, will be a ſtrong retentiue to wauerers, when they ſee the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the preſent popiſh impieties, to be patroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by your good Lordſhip. Great and many were the benefits which the Church of God obtained by the ſincere and godlie profeſſion of the Goſpell, which your Lordſhips moſt honorable anceſtors did make. Your Lordſhips<note n="*" place="margin">The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke.</note> grandmother did ſuffer much for the Goſpell, euen vnto baniſhment; her Graces faithfulnes appeared herein, that in the daies of her proſperitie, and peace at home, ſhe is<note n="*" place="margin">By Maſter <hi>R.

Your moſt honourable father, with the bleſſed ſword of <hi>Gedeon,</hi> did fight in the defence of the Goſpell; and in a ſicknes, thought inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſtood ſo reſolued in the truth, that hee deſired none other graue, than to die in the defence of the Goſpell, and of his Queene. Both of them regarded the Lords Prophets, and them that feared his name, both ſmall and great. Their vertues haue a part in the booke of life, in the holie citie, and in the things
<pb facs="tcp:18660:4"/> which are written in this booke. Honourable Lord, the loue you beare to the Goſpell, and your wiſdome in taking to wife a daughter of the true God, doe make demonſtration that your Lordſhip doth inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the vertues of your moſt <hi>Christian</hi> anceſtrie.

Let the faithfulnes and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull affection of the giuer, counterpoiſe the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the handling.

And why? they were worldly minded, proud, ambicious,<note place="margin">Act. 3.18.</note> and puffed vp with the opinion of their owne knowledge, they had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the truth with their owne deuices, and in their blinde imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion framed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſuch a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that when the true <hi>Chriſt</hi> was come they could not know him: they expected a great Monarch, that ſhould reſtore vnto them their earthly kingdome and the pleaſures of the world; meane while, they crucified the true <hi>Sauiour,</hi> and fulfilled all things that were written of him. Onely a few fiſher-men, and certaine poore and abiect women followed <hi>Chriſt</hi> and beleeued in him:<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.14.</note> 
               <hi>for the ſecret of the Lord vvas reuealed to them that feared him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the New Teſtament in like manner, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew the comming of the Great ANTICHRIST, they paint him out in his colours, what manner of one he ſhould be; declaring the time, place and manner of his birth, life, tyrannie, pride, ruine and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and ſhewing that ſuch as make greateſt ſhew to the contrarie, ſhould be the chiefeſt actors in this tragedie. The <hi>Pope,</hi> his <hi>Cardinals,</hi> his great <hi>Prelats</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of all ſorts reade and ſtudie theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and are (to a naturall mans conceit) as likely to attaine the true ſenſe of them, as any other: they talke much of the comming of this Monſter, and yet themſelues play all the parts in this Tragedie. And why ſo? they are as proud as the <hi>Phariſies,</hi> ſelfe-louers, ambicious, they haue corrupted the holy Scriptures with the leuen of their owne doctrine, they haue their fabulous inuentions touching <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> ſo that they cannot know him: They looke for an indiuiduall Tyrant, a <hi>Jew</hi> borne, of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> who ſhall raigne but three yeeres and a halfe in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18660:5"/> and worke I know not what wonders: meane time themſelues indeede are that true <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and haue almoſt fulfilled whatſoeuer is written of him. <hi>O Lord hovv vnſearchable are thy iudgements, that haſt ſent them ſtrong deluſion,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> wonder at our confidence in this point, and thinke the <hi>Reuelation</hi> to be ſo myſtical, that no certainty can be concluded thence.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Onorable, and right reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the mercie of <hi>God</hi> hath alvvaies abounded towards his Church, in giuing her <hi>Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scriptures,</hi> as a light that ſhineth in a darke place: ſo verie ſeldome haue there been wanting godly Prophets, who by diligent ſearch haue ſo dreſſed theſe lights, that they haue ſhined to all that were about them, for their directions in the greateſt mutations and difficulties. For the moſt part, vntill the time of the Apoſtles, this kinde of ſtudie was ſo frequent and familiar, not onely to the good, but alſo to the bad; that many times it ſeemed <hi>Eliſha</hi> was not dead,<note place="margin">2. King. 6.12.</note> that <hi>tolde the words which the King ſpake in his priuie chamber.</hi> Howbeit, though neuer Church had prophecies ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb facs="tcp:18660:6"/> and plaine, as this of Chriſt hath vnder the Goſpell; yet am I perſwaded (I ſpeake at your Lordſhips correction) that no age hath been ſo ignorant in the true vnderſtanding of ſuch as concerned their times, as (for of long after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles) the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church hath been. For as all the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of the New Testament, which are many, haue been esteemed difficult: ſo this booke of the <hi>Reuelation</hi> hath been held impregnable.</p>
            <p>Now it is a part of <hi>S. Pauls apologie</hi> to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20.27.</note> 
               <hi>I haue ſhewed you all the counſel of God.</hi> The diduction from thence, bindeth all the Miniſterie to endeuour the like, aſwell in Propheticall, as Dogmaticall Scriptures. I haue therefore ſomewhat laboured in this kinde, but principally in this booke; and that (all praiſe be giuen to the Father of lights) to mine owne ſatisfaction in ſuch ſort, as that many godly men haue deſired to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in my contentment herein.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.32.</note>But the Scripture commandeth, that the <hi>Spirit of the Prophets be ſubiect to the Prophets;</hi> forbidding all to beleeue, or teach any thing, that will not endure the cenſure of the Prophets. The rather ought I to ſubiect that which I haue done herein, vnto your Lordſhips godly and learned cenſure, as a Father among the Prophets, becauſe I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in this kinde, in a different manner from the reſt of the Interpreters. If your Lordſhip like it, I haue enough. If you correct me,<note place="margin">Pſal. 141.5.</note> where I erre, though you ſmite me I will take it kindly, and when any ſhall ſay vnto me, <hi>What are theſe wounds in thy hands?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 13.6.</note> I will anſwere, <hi>Thus was I wounded in the houſe of my friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better direction of your Lordſhips graue and learned cenſure, I will communicate ſome part of my thoughts herein: for mine affectation of breuitie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:18660:6"/> reaſons of conſequence, haue cauſed me to ſuppreſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of good importance.</p>
            <p>When I firſt tooke the Booke in hand to ſtudie it, I ſaw it was generally accuſed by friend and foe, for inextricable hardnes. But when I read the text, and ſaw the title to be a<note n="a" place="margin">cap. 1.1.</note> 
               <hi>Reuelation,</hi> which is the<note n="b" place="margin">1. Sam. 2.17.</note> cleereſt and plaineſt kinde of teaching, the<note n="c" place="margin">cap. 1.2.</note> 
               <hi>Reader</hi> to be <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and the Booke to be<note n="d" place="margin">cap. 22.10.</note> 
               <hi>vnſealed,</hi> I durſt not obiect any difficultie to the Booke; but began to inquire how it came to paſſe, that it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted ſo hard.</p>
            <p>The <hi>phraſe,</hi> though ſtrange in appearance, is meerely propheticall. The <hi>method,</hi> though cloſely couched, is very Logicall. Wherefore the fault muſt be laid elſewhere, and not vpon the Booke, that it ſeemeth ſo darke and difficult.</p>
            <p>The reaſons of the hardnes, vpon diligent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I reſolued were theſe, amongst others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the iudgements of men haue been of long ſo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled with the doctrine, that the ſignes of the latter day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are come, that the Interpreters haue laboured to finde the accompliſhment of the Booke in the ſtories paſt. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many things were not yet fulfilled, they knew not where they were when they tooke the booke in hand. They that in this age doe ſtraine their wits, to ſee who can bring firſt newes of <hi>Chriſts</hi> laſt comming, beſides that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure this booke, they would haue vs to breake the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when many ſhall ſay,<note place="margin">Luk. 21.8.</note> 
               <hi>The time draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neere,</hi> doth enioyne vs thus: <hi>Follow ye not them therefore.</hi> As alſo to violate the rule of the Apostle, which is, <hi>not to be troubled by any deceit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2.1.2</note> 
               <hi>as if the day of Chriſt were at hand,</hi> till <hi>Antichriſt</hi> haue all things fulfilled vpon him, which are written in this <hi>Reuelation. S. Peter</hi> ſeemeth to giue the reaſon, when he ſheweth that
<pb facs="tcp:18660:7"/> the vntimely vrging of the laſt comming of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.3.4.</note> would be the mother of <hi>Atheiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when many doe vndertake to interpret the booke, they miſse in the firſt foundation of their labour. For whereas it is moſt euident, that the booke is meerely prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, foreſhewing the particulars of things preſent and to come; ſome of the Writers haue fled from this ground, vpon which onely there can be a ſafe building ſet vp, and haue laboured to make it <hi>Dogmaticall,</hi> containing certaine points of doctrine, handled before more largely and more plainly in the reſt of the Scriptures: which cannot be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without ſome aduantage to the enemies of the truth; nor without ſome miſbeſeeming imputations to the holie Ghoſt, by whoſe direction the booke is written.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, many doe labour to make the booke an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Hiſtorie, from the birth, or preaching, or aſcenſion of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but miſtaking the time when to begin, they put the whole ſtorie cleane out of ioynt. Beſides, by that proiect, they commit this abſurditie, to ſay, that the things which were ſpoken and done in the eares and eyes of all men in the time of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were in the time of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſo cloſely <hi>ſealed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 5.3.</note> as that <hi>none in heauen, nor in earth, nor vnder the earth was able to open them, nor looke thereon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, ſome of the Interpreters haue laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Seales, Trumpets and Phials to certaine numbers of yeeres: but ſeeing the text in many places doth giue vs the knowledge of the viſions, by the onely diuerſitie of the mutations which befall the Church; wee may not tie our ſelues to numbers, but onely where the text doth bound the mutations with numbers.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, when as godly men had truly found, that the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
<pb facs="tcp:18660:7"/> and corruptions of the Church of Rome, are liuely deſcribed in ſome parts of the booke, they haue alſo laboured to applie all the texts to Rome, which doe containe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and properties of the enemies of the Church. But becauſe in the booke is alſo handled of other enemies; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the booke is obſcured by this courſe, the enemie is aduantaged that eſpieth our weaknes, and the propheticall ſpirit is very much preiudiced; which being more generall, is wronged by reſtraint.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, the Historians, who in the iudgements of all men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> are to be beſt helpes, firſt haue bin careleſſe in ſetting downe the exact times of the occurrences, which they write of; ſo that ſomtimes it is worke more than enough to agree them. And then they haue rather conſulted with their friends, than with <hi>S. Iohn</hi> for the heads of their obſeruations. For the moſt of them doe labour rather to magnifie their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones, and to ſet a glaſſe vpon a faction, than to deliuer the truth. Hereby it commeth to paſſe, that hee that readeth moſt of them, ſhall be ſure to finde much wearines to the fleſh; howſoeuer he may happily here and there finde a wiſe and vpright ſentence.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, there hath been found no age, till of late, ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> free from ostentation and ſelfe-loue, but that the leaders of the times haue made it as good as mortall, to reprooue the monstrous conditions of the time, which are liuely deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed here by the true interpretation of this booke: ſo that vpon paine of death it muſt be made to ſpeake nothing at all, or any thing, rather than againſt the time, whatſoeuer be the truth.</p>
            <p>Eightly, ſome alſo haue not let to blaſpheme this kinde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> of ſtudie as phantasticall and curious; containing either verie little, or that which <hi>God</hi> hath put in his owne and
<pb facs="tcp:18660:8"/> onely power; and that no doctrine can be enforced out of Scriptures of this kinde.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, theſe things, together with the multitude of bookes to be read, (which neither pouertie can prouide, nor weaknes ſtudie) and the want of due conference of this booke with the former prophecies, to whom it ſendeth his reader, I take to be ſome of the effectuall reaſons, which haue impeached the labours of many herein.</p>
            <p>It remaineth now that I giue an accompt how I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the proiect, which I haue laid, is the onely true and eaſie meanes of vnderstanding the booke.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the text doth ſay, that it ſerueth <hi>to ſhew the things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">cap. 1.1.</note> 
               <hi>which muſt ſhortly be done.</hi> Whereupon I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>THE THINGS DONE ARE THE BOOKE.</hi> Wherefore of force it doth follow, that the viſions may, and onely muſt, be enlightened, by the carefull application of <hi>ALL</hi> the Eccleſiaſticall histories vnto them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the things are ſhewed <hi>to the ſeruants of God.</hi> Then muſt <hi>the ſeruants of God</hi> tell vs what they haue ſeene, if we meane to know them. And ſo we deſpiſe the iudgements of them in this booke, which perſecute the ſeruants of God, be they otherwiſe for learning as profound as the diuell.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>the time was at hand</hi> of the prophecie. For <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was to <hi>write the things which were in action,</hi>
               <note place="margin">cap. 1.9. cap. 1.19.</note> at the time of his writing, <hi>and the things which were to come afterwards.</hi> Wherefore, without all question, <hi>the booke was to begin when it was firſt publiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon theſe three grounds I am bold to conclude, that <hi>The booke is a perfect Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">NB. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Reuelation.</note> 
               <hi>ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſeruants of God, containing whatſoeuer is materiall in the Church, from the time of the being
<pb facs="tcp:18660:8"/> of S. Iohn in Patmos, to the end of the world.</hi> So that nothing of importance can bee found in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world, which may not be referred to ſome part of this booke, as to his proper head; from whence it is to receiue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie whether it be true or falſe; and alſo ſuch due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and cenſure, that it muſt be esteemed to be good or bad, according as the booke doth iudge.</p>
            <p>Of which my aſſertion, I find not any of the Interpreters greatly to doubt; yet none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (that I know) hath attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee, how he can make the text, and all ſtories of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſo to agree, that the collection of the mutations, with their cauſes and effects, may ſeeme worthie the holy Ghoſt. Wherefore, though I doe acknowledge my ſelfe euery way the moſt vnfit of all others; yet rather than it ſhould be vndone, I haue thought good to geſſe at it, as well as God hath ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me, with the ſmall Librarie, and other meane helpes, which my poore eſtate would affoord me.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip may not looke here for a perfect <hi>Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> and interpretation of the whole booke; for that is a worke for a iuſt and full Commentarie, which here I promiſe not: but haue onely minded a generall diſpoſing of the text for the ſtorie: and therefore was not to be diligent, either in the preparations to the viſions, or in the Scriptures not yet accompliſhed. What I thinke of the reſt not greatly touched here, (as of the firſt fiue Chapters, containing the things which were in hand in the time of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that which was to follow; what of the <hi>ſixt</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Phials,</hi> &amp;c. which import the confederacie of both religions, againſt the incurſions of the <hi>Turkes;</hi> the great incredible and fearfull ſtirres that are yet to be betweene the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and the godly; and of the diuiſion of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts among themſelues; and what of the reſt of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb facs="tcp:18660:9"/> which containeth the golden and happie daies of the Church, and the new troubles which ſhall ariſe when <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> is caſt into hell; of the preciſe computation of the time, of as many of theſe things as is to be made by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the text:) I hope it will not be looked for here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nature of this Treatiſe doth not require it: yet happily, by the bleſsing of <hi>God,</hi> may hereafter appeare, if none doe better preuent me; which I much deſire. That which I ſay my ſelfe, is, that by this proiect I haue bin able readily to reduce all ſtories of importance, to their certaine heads of the <hi>Reuelation:</hi> and to ſee the drifts and deuices of many writers, and ſome other perſons, before I ſaw the particulars in themſelues. And alſo to geſſe trulie before ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the future effects of ſome things, which, for any thing I could perceiue, were in mans reaſon to fall out otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>That which I haue done, I ſubmit in the feare of <hi>God,</hi> not onely vnto your Lordſhip, but alſo vnto all ſuch godlie Fathers and brethren of the Miniſterie, who in the feare of <hi>God</hi> doe handle or regard his word. For the ignorant, as I doe much deſire their edification; ſo I neglect their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The ſcornefull reiections of the malicious and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie that neglecteth, and with ſcoffing cauils and railings maligneth whatſoeuer doth not make for his phantaſie and partialitie, I eſteeme as ſuch reproofes, as I will weare for a garland. As for the harſh phraſe and haſte in tranſlations, ſeeing I ſeeke matter, whether digested, or congeſted, the godly will excuſe.</p>
            <p>That which I would firſt admoniſh the diligent Reader of, is this. The booke hath a double method. Firſt is ſet down the drift of <hi>God,</hi> in diſpoſing the things of the <hi>Church,</hi> in the manner which he hath done; and this reacheth from the beginning, to the end of the eleuenth chapter. Secondly
<pb facs="tcp:18660:9"/> is ſhewed the drift of the <hi>Diuell</hi> in his proceedings against the <hi>Church,</hi> in the twelfth and thirteenth chapters, and part of the twentith chapter. The reſt, to the end, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of ſuch things, as were briefly touched in ſome former chapters. In my Treatiſe I haue for ſhortnes and cleerenes ioyned both the methods in one, and put the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations into the places for which they ſerue.</p>
            <p>The next thing I would admoniſh, is, that I haue diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Treatiſe into ſeuerall periods and chapters; not according to the chapters of the booke, but according to the diuerſitie of the mutations. Thirdly, that in gathering of the ſtories, I haue not tied my ſelfe to the whole diſcourſe word for word, for it would haue growne to too great a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, but haue briefed them for caſe. And where I thinke the Authors cenſure of the times doth agree with the text, I keepe it. Where the writer, by ignorance or partialitie, doth miſſe in his diſcerning, I take the briefe of the ſtorie, and paſſe by his opinion, excepting in ſome very few places plain enough to be diſcerned. Furthermore, where the Hiſtorians in their bookes doe follow the ſucceſsion of yeeres and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I hold it ſufficient to name the author, committing the reader to the eaſie direction of the yeere and perſon: but where any thing might ſeeme comberſome to finde, I haue bin more plaine, giuing readie helpe to ſuch as haue bookes of the ſame edition which I followed. Thus leauing my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not onely to the touchſtone, but alſo to the teſt, I pray for your Lordſhips happines, and the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>

A doctrine of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> henceforth, in ſome ſort common to the papacie with the <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> But the former hereſies they ſhare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them thus. What hath been heretically taught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Trinitie, the <hi>Mahumetanes</hi> take vp. What againſt pietie, or holines, the popiſh beaſt doth embrace.</p>
               <p>Hereupon is heard a commaundement to looſe theſe Angels; and then the execution of the commaundement doth follow.</p>
               <p>Of the commaundement, firſt is ſhewed the place from whence it came, and then the matter commaunded.</p>
               <p>As for the place, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith<note n="k" place="margin">cap. 9.13.</note> 
                  <hi>I heard a certaine voyce from the foure hornes of the golden Altar which is before God;</hi> meaning that he heard the voyce from Chriſt <hi>Ieſus,</hi> as he is the high Prieſt; the Mediator to make reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and man. For that was ſignified by the<note n="l" place="margin">Leuit. 16.16. Heb. 9.24.</note> 
                  <hi>goul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Altar</hi> in the Tabernacle. Now becauſe that from hence commeth not an aſſurance of reconciliation; but a curſe; It is an argument that the world had corrupted the doctrine of the reconciliation of Chriſt, either in his perſon; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by offering their prayers by<note n="a" place="margin">Leuit. 10.1.</note> ſtrange fire, with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of men; as did <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu;</hi> or arrogated the<note n="b" place="margin">Numb. 16.21.</note> prieſts office, as <hi>Chorah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram;</hi> or making themſelues mediators by the merit of their prayers.<note n="c" place="margin">See Ruff.

So likewiſe in the Weſt he was made interceſſor for the dead; and others alſo were ioyned with him in the office of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, as the <hi>virgin Mary, Peter, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> as if he himſelfe were vnſufficient, &amp;c. which alſo cauſed this fearefull curſe to be ſent vpon the Empire in the Weſt, to vexe it &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The matter of the commaundement is,<note n="d" place="margin">cap. 9.14.</note> 
                  <hi>that the ſixt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel which had the Trumpet, ſhould looſe the foure Angels which were bound at the great riuer Euphrates,</hi> that is, that thoſe foure nations of the <hi>Perſians, Saracens, Turkes, or Parthians, and Tartars, or Sarmatians,</hi> which were bound, either by league, or affinity, or the ſtrength of the waters, or rockes; neere to the head ſtreame, or fall of the great riuer <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi> ſhould be looſed from their bond, by the miniſtrie of Angels, bringing in new doctrine, ſo that of friends they ſhould become foes.</p>
               <p>The execution of this commaundement doth follow, by thoſe foure nations; both ready and fierce.</p>

               <p>The ciuill Princes doe labour to keepe their authoritie and poſſeſſion; doe bring to light the truth of that <hi>which the thunders haue ſpoken; &amp; deliuer the booke of the word of God to ſuch poore Preachers,</hi> as doe make a conſcience of the ſame, and are ready to ſuffer for it.</p>
               <p>In the prophecie of diſcouering the truth of that, which the confuſed and tumultuous thunders haue ſpoken,<note n="c" place="margin">cap. 10.4.</note> are theſe things to be conſidered.

Hereupon it is, that the hiſtories of theſe later times doe deliuer the trueth; yet in ſuch ſort, as very fewe can picke it out by them, the face of the ſtorie loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one way, and the trueth another way.

               </p>
               <p>As concerning the deliuerie of the booke of Gods word to Preachers: firſt, it is ſaid, that all godly men perceiuing a better courſe to conſume <hi>Antichrist by,</hi> than to write his ſtorie plaine, doe, <hi>as</hi>

                  <hi>a voyce from heauen, bid thoſe of the ſpirit of Saint Iohn,</hi> to leaue the huge volumes of Legends, decrees and decretals, &amp;c. and <hi>goe and take the booke (of the Scriptures) which is open in the Angels hand,</hi> preſenting the Magiſtracie, though it be ſhut to all others.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>they be the firſt fruits, holy vnto God, and to the Lambe.</hi> For theſe onely are<note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 12.17.18.</note> dedicated vnto the Lord, to ſanctifie the reſt of mankind: which, if theſe were away, were altogether vnholy and prophane in their pretended profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God and his <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And ſo in theſe times, there would be no Church at all.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Iſerable are now the times, by reaſon of the groſſe ignorance and ſuperſtition, which preuailed. For by the tyrannie of the Popes, all men were ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or terrified from the ſtudy and profeſſion of true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. And the wickednes of the Friers by purloyning, in a manner all good bookes (which now were but manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts) and teaching nothing but fables; had made it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuſpected, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> would take this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to obliterate the Scriptures  and obtrude vnto the world any ſuch forged diuinitie, which might beſt ſerue to further his ambition.</p>
               <p>In the time of this palpable darkenes, worſe then euer was any in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when as the truth lay as dead, and buried for euer; the Lord in mercy doth raiſe it from <hi>death</hi> to <hi>life.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Of this warre we are to conſider the enemies; their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fight, and the ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>The enemies are the two witneſſes,<note n="a" place="margin">cap. 19.13.</note> vnder their captaine; yet in the wildernes, in this chapter; and in the bleſſed time, ſeparated from <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in the next chapter; and<note n="b" place="margin">19.</note> the beaſt with his Kings.</p>
               <p>The captaine of theſe witneſſes, is mighty to enable them to finiſh their teſtimony.</p>

                  <hi>I ſaw heauen open,</hi> that is, an expectation of all good men which belong to the kingdome of heauen, what will be the end of thoſe cruell lawes, and bloudy executions.</p>
               <p>That which befell was this, <hi>An</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">cap. 18.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Angel came downe from heauen, hauing great power, ſo that the earth was lightened with his glory,</hi> that is, the <hi>glorious Goſpel,</hi> which now was excluded by all men, came by the mighty hand of God to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and preached; to the diſpelling of the darkenes, which <hi>Antichriſt</hi> brought into the earth; as if it had been brought from heauen, by the miniſtery of a <hi>mighty Angel,</hi> to enlighten men. In the parable of this <hi>Angel,</hi> by whom is ſignified the <hi>Lambe Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who is preached to the world; firſt is ſet downe the deſcription of himſelfe and his retinue; and then his warres.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18660:111"/> him did get among perſons of honour, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that ſate vpon this white horſe,</hi> was called (and reputed) <hi>faithfull and true;</hi> euery way ſincere. Contrary to the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the Popes; who were ſo vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their actions, and ſo falſe in their words and writings, that no man could ſafely truſt what they ſaid or did.</p>
               <p>He is alſo ſaid to <hi>iudge and fight righteouſly;</hi> dealing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly with all men, and iuſtly contending with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by word and deede; ſo that he decideth all queſtions truely and rightly; and confuteth and impugneth his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries according to the preciſe rule of equitie. Contrary to the Popes, who decide all doubts, and fight all their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes as may beſt ſerue their onely partialities and profites, without reſpect to iuſtice; and hereof are notoriouſly knowen to be guilty.</p>
               <p>His ability to iudge righteouſly appeareth by this, <hi>that</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">cap. 19.12.</note> 
                  <hi>his eyes are as a flame of fire,</hi> by his cleere and piercing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, truely diſcerning the very ſecrets of all things, which he looketh vpon, euen as they be. Contrary to the Popes, whoſe ignorance, or malice maketh them vnable through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to perceiue and ſee, much leſſe to foreſee things as they be; as appeareth by their continuall accuſing of innocents, and acquiting of vngodly perſons. And contrary to the popiſh Clergie, who know nothing, but what is reuealed to them by confeſſion of ſuch as neither will, nor can tell all; whereas<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 4.12.13.</note> all things are naked and manifeſt to him, with whom we haue to doe, to wit, <hi>the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As an argument of the iuſtnes of his warres and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>he hath</hi>

                  <hi>many crownes on his head;</hi> ſignifying the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority of the Scriptures to bee ſuch, as that all Kings and Princes and people, are in right ſubiects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto; and ſo in this period ſhall acknowledge themſelues to be; ſo that when he fighteth, it is to ſubdue his rebels. Affronting the wicked <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Popes, who arrogantly
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18660:112"/> weare a triple crowne, vſurping authoritie and tyranniſing ouer ſuch as they haue no intereſt in, but are, and ought to be ſubiects of <hi>the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the name of this rider, it is ſaid, <hi>he hath a name written which no man knew but himſelfe;</hi> to ſhew, that when the Popes, or others, do arrogate to themſelues alone, the ſenſe and vnderſtanding of the Scriptures, as if they were to iudge thereof alone,<note n="d" place="margin">Specul.

And hereof great perſecution is to riſe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, he is ſaid<note n="e" place="margin">cap. 19.13.</note> to <hi>be clothed in a garment dipt in blood,</hi> to ſignifie the great effuſion of bloud, by the martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſuch which ſhould ſtand for the authority of the word of God againſt the beaſt <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> For from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, the great queſtion is, of the authoritie, ſufficiency, and vnderſtanding of the Scriptures; about which are great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and perſecutions.</p>
               <p>His <hi>garment is alſo dipt in blood,</hi> to teach, that at laſt<note n="f" place="margin">Iſai. 63.1.2.3.</note> he ſhall victoriouſly triumph ouer his enemies, ſo as his <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall be red with the blood of the ſlaine.</hi> This wonderfull perſon, in plaine tearmes, is<note n="a" place="margin">cap. 19.13.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Of the manner of this riders fighting, it is ſaid that his weapons are ſure, and his confidence full of all aſſurance. Concerning his weapons, it is ſaid, that<note n="g" place="margin">cap. 19.15.</note> 
                  <hi>out of his mouth went a ſharpe ſworde;</hi> ſo mighty and ſtrong, that with it, <hi>he ſhould ſmite the heathen;</hi> ſignifying both the ſharpe, and feruent, and mighty confutations of the wicked, which ſhould be taken from the word of God; ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince all the policy and ſuperſtition of the Gentiles, the papiſts, by a word of his mouth; and alſo the hot warres, which the preaching of the word ſhould raiſe againſt <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> and the remnant, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>His confidence in this warre, is ſo great, that he doth giue aſſurance to all, that in the end <hi>He</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 2.9.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall rule the heathen with a rod of yron,</hi> keeping them vnder by ſeuere and mortall lawes. The reaſon of which aſſurance, is, that. He it is, that by the ordinance of almighty God <hi>treadeth the winepreſſe,</hi> as a ſeuere executioner <hi>of the fiercenes and wrath of almighty God,</hi> againſt all his enemies.</p>
               <p>Firſt in token of his confidence, to triumph ouer all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſo that Kings, and Lords, &amp;c. ſhall be his ſubiects, and ſeruants; <hi>he</hi>

               <p>Secondly, to encourage his ſouldiers, and terrifie his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he cauſeth it to be generally proclaimed, or preached, as if<note n="l" place="margin">cap. 14.8. &amp; 18.2.</note>

                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:18660:113"/> The reaſons of this fearefull iudgement, are firſt,<note n="a" place="margin">cap. 18.3.</note> becauſe <hi>ſhe made all nations to drinke of the wine of the wrath of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications;</hi> by diuerſe interdictions, execrations, exactions, tumults, treaſons, rebellions, murthers, maſſacres, &amp;c, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greiuous calamities vpon ſuch, as refuſed to bee ſubiect vnto the idolatrie, ſuperſtitions, and other filthie conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that policicie, or citie.</p>

               <p>Firſt they feare becauſe their cauſe on the contrary part was ſo much affected by their friends, and ſo earneſtly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued to their holy praiſe and eternall commendations, that whereas the beaſt had accurſed them as diuels, to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit, they are as truly honored for Martyres, as if<note n="g" place="margin">cap. 11.12.</note>

                  <hi>at the ſame houre</hi> or inſtant, when this due regard is giuen to theſe two witneſſes, which were thus wickedly murthered, <hi>there was a great earthquake,</hi> and emotion in the hearts and hands of many, mooued by the indignitie of their death.

And the ſumme is this, that certainelie it can not be, but the kings will alſo be conuerted to the Goſpell by whoſe onely and holy adminiſtrations <hi>The kingdomes of this world are</hi> (to be) <hi>our Lords, and his Christs and he ſhall reigne for euermore.</hi> Hereupon all godly magiſtrates and miniſters, called by the name of the<note n="c" place="margin">cap. 11.16.</note>

               <p>Secondly, they doe alſo leaue the ſeruice of idols and men, and in their places <hi>worſhip God,</hi> both with praiſes, and adminiſtration of iuſtice.</p>
               <p>As for their praiſes, <hi>they</hi> do in effect, <hi>ſay,</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">cap. 11.17.</note> 
                  <hi>we giue thee thankes Lord God almightie, which art, and which waſt, and which art to come;</hi> euen the ſame God which art euerlaſting, for that taking the power out of the hands of mortall, weake, and mutable men, who of long time haue trodden thy ſanctuarie vnder foote, <hi>thou hast receiued</hi> (the entrance and poſſeſſion of) <hi>thy great might, and haſt obtained thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> in due time to bee fully and alone adminiſtred by thee.</p>
               <p>As for their ſincere adminiſtration of iuſtice, they ſhew that they ſo regard the faithfull profeſſion of the Goſpell, that thereupon, ſuch which rather profeſſed the vanitie of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> then <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (euen the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Papiſts) <hi>were</hi>

                  <hi>angrie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cauſe of their anger is, firſt, that <hi>the time is come of the wrath of God,</hi> to be inflicted vpon whoſoeuer ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it; without reſpect of perſons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe they ſee that <hi>the time is come of the dead,</hi> which haue been martyred, for the witnes of <hi>Ieſus;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:18660:127"/> that they ſhould be iudged,</hi> whether they died as innocents or not; ſo that the proceedings againſt ſuch come to be looked into and examined againe by iuſtice faithfully, which they are angrie ſhould be knowen.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe that God hath raiſed vp Chriſtian Kings, that God by them <hi>ſhould giue rewarde vnto his ſeruants, the prophets,</hi> which doe ſincerely ſpeake the truth from the Lord; whereas <hi>Antichriſt did tread them vnder foote.</hi> Yea, becauſe the time was come, that he by Princes ſhould <hi>giue reward alſo to the Saints, and to them that</hi> (in deede) <hi>doe feare his name to ſmall and great,</hi> whom <hi>Antichriſt</hi> expoſed to death and confiſcation, loading them with reproches, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe the time is come, that God by Princes <hi>ſhould vtterly deſtroy them, which deſtroy the earth,</hi> be they Turkes or Papiſts.</p>
               <p>The aduancement of the godly, and deſtruction of the wicked, according to the exact rule of iuſtice, <hi>in the word of God,</hi> being thus drifted by godly Gouernors; thoſe of the ſpirit of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>

                  <hi>ſaw another great and marueilous ſigne in heauen,</hi> the Church of God. Namely, that God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>ſeuen Angels, hauing the ſeuen laſt plagues,</hi> which he would inflict vpon his enemies, for, not by men, but <hi>by them,</hi> euen by a diuine hand, <hi>is now to be fulfilled the wrath of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe plagues, we are to conſider the place whence theſe Angels doe receiue them, and the powring of them forth.</p>
               <p>Theſe plagues are deliuered vnto them <hi>in the temple; which,</hi> after the godly doe put on zeale and thankeſgiuing, <hi>is opened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the zeale of the godly, firſt is declared how the true doctrine of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> baptiſme is reſtored, namely that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to be vndefiled, and zealous in the cauſe of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For the lauer of regeneration is now figured

Or that the Church may in time deuiſe more to bee added thereto, other differing from it, or ſome contrary vnto it, of like authoritie and reuerence?

For where they wrote the things, which they thought were to be beleeued, they haue written<note n="c" place="margin">Conſuls.</note> the <hi>Popes, Councels</hi> and places, moneth, and laſtly the day, that it might be manifeſt to all wiſe men, that their faith had no beginning, before the beginning of the raigne of<note n="d" place="margin">Conſtantius.</note> ſuch <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councels;</hi> yea that which is more, all of them hauing regard vnto their owne hereſie, haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their owne ſentences to writing. Moreouer when they pretend to write of the doctrine of the Lord, they haue named another for their Lord, namely<note n="e" place="margin">Conſtantius.</note> the <hi>Pope:</hi> For he hath opened vnto them a window vnto all their impiety. And when as they did denie the word of the Sonne of God, to be eternall (for ſo farre were theſe enemies of <hi>Chriſt</hi> caſt into wickedneſſe) they haue named the<note n="f" place="margin">Emperor.</note> decrees of the <hi>Popes</hi> to be eternall. But perchance they catch an occaſion
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18660:146"/> to name the<note n="g" place="margin">Conſuls.</note> 
               <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councels,</hi> by the example of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Prophets,</hi> who do ſet downe the time in which they liued. But if they ſhall dare to affirme ſo, they ſhall exceedingly bewray their folly. For albeit there be mention of the times in the prophecies of holy men, as in <hi>Eſaiah</hi> and <hi>Hoſea,</hi> which were in the daies of <hi>Ozias</hi> and <hi>Ioatham,</hi> &amp; <hi>Achaz</hi> and <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias:</hi> as in the prophecie of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> who liued in the dayes of <hi>Ieſias:</hi> as in the prophecies of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> who flouriſhed when <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> did raigne, and laſtly as in other Prophets which prophecied in other times: yet doe none of them lay any firſt foundation of pietie and holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For it was before their times, and alwaies, and before the framing of the world which God by <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for vs. And as for the times in which their faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan they did not deſigne (for before thoſe times, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were faithfull) but thoſe were the times of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe pronounced by them. And the promiſe doth eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerne the incarnation of our Sauiour. That which was annexed thereunto did clearely demonſtrate thoſe things which ſhould befall the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But in the times ſo noted the doctrine of faith (as I ſaid before) had not his beginning, but the Prophets ſhewed in what times they liued, when they prophecied theſe things. But theſe our wiſe men, when they doe not write things done, nor forſhew things to come, but doe write <hi>our faith was ſet forth;</hi> preſently they annexe the<note n="h" place="margin">Conſuls.</note> 
               <hi>Pope, Councel,</hi> moneth and day. As godly men doe ſet downe the times of things done, as alſo of their miniſterie; ſo thoſe doe note the time in which their doctrine and faith began and was firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted. And I would indeede they had committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their owne only faith; but now they make the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the doctrine of faith; and as though it had not been before, they attempt to diſpute thereof. For they do not thus write. <hi>So wee do beleeue,</hi> but in this ſort, <hi>The catholicke faith was ſet forth.</hi> Therefore the audacious attempt of this their inſtitution, doth manifeſtly conuict their groſſe folly; and the new inſtituted manner of their forme ſo deſcribed, doth euery way equall the hereſie of the <hi>Arian.</hi> For ſo
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:18660:147"/> haue they taught by their writings. <hi>Then began they to beleeue ſo,</hi> and from thence they determine to ſhew their faith. Not otherwiſe then it is in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> the Euangeliſt: <hi>There came forth an edicte of taxing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk 1.</note> This edict indeede was not before, but from thoſe daies it began, and was ſet forth by them that did write it. So when theſe did write thus: <hi>Now is the faith ſet forth,</hi> they do ſhew that their error was now lately deuiſed, and that before it was not extant. But if they ſhall adde the word <hi>Catholike</hi> (as the <hi>Arians</hi> did, and <hi>Papiſts</hi> do) they ruſh vnaduiſedly into the wicked peruerſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the <hi>Cataphrygians,</hi> that according to their manner they alſo ſay, <hi>the chriſtian faith is reuealed to vs, and it began of vs.</hi> And as thoſe their <hi>Maximilla</hi> and <hi>Montanus,</hi> ſo they, for <hi>Christ,</hi> doe call<note n="i" place="margin">Conſtantius.</note> the Pope <hi>Lord.</hi> Now if in their times, and theſe<note n="k" place="margin">Conſuls.</note> Popes the faith had his beginning, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Fathers and bleſſed Martyrs, what of theſe whom themſelues haue inſtructed and were dead before theſe<note n="l" place="margin">Conſuls.</note> Popes? By what meanes will they raiſe them from the dead, that they may altogether roote out of their minds the things which they taught them, and engraffe into them the things which now they haue deuiſed and written? So abſurd and ſenſeles they bee, that they haue onely skill to forge counterfeit matters, which as they are fooliſh and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; ſo may they bee reprooued and refuted very eaſily. Thus much <hi>Athanaſius</hi> would ſay to them as hee ſaid to the <hi>Arians.</hi>
